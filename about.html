      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This website was developed as a part of our academic project for the course "Introduction to Cognitive Science" under the Biotechnology department. Our aim was to explore the basics of web development and how digital interfaces align with human cognitive functions.</p>
      <p>Through this website, we have demonstrated our understanding of how websites are built using HTML for structure and CSS for design. We have also highlighted the relevance of digital tools in modern learning environments, especially for students in non-technical fields like medicine and biotechnology.</p>

      <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
      <p>This site provides a foundational understanding of web development including the concepts of frontend, backend, and full-stack development. We wanted to connect our scientific field with the world of coding by learning how user-friendly interfaces help convey complex information effectively â€” a core concern in cognitive science.</p>
      <p>Moreover, building this website helped us realize how crucial digital literacy is even for students in health and science fields. It showed us that programming can support innovations in biotechnology, such as interactive learning platforms, digital patient records, and virtual experiments.</p>

      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <p>We learned how the fundamentals of web development can be used to create educational and informative content. We discovered how design, layout, and user experience can be linked to cognitive ease and learning efficiency. We also learned how to troubleshoot issues, format content for readability, and present information in a user-friendly manner.</p>
