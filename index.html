      <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p>Web development refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It encompasses everything from simple static web pages to complex web-based applications, social network services, and electronic business applications. The main aspects of web development include web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration.</p>
      <p>There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. Front-end development deals with the visual and interactive parts of a website — what the user sees and experiences. This includes HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, focuses on what goes on behind the scenes — the server, databases, and application logic. Full-stack developers are those who are proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
      <p>Modern web development involves a wide array of tools and frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js for the front-end and Node.js, Django, Laravel for the back-end. Developers also rely on version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub to collaborate and manage their codebase. Web development is a dynamic field, constantly evolving with new trends, tools, and technologies.</p>

      <h2>Frontend vs Backend</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Refers to the user-facing side of the website. Technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. Frontend developers focus on design, layout, and interactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Refers to the server-side of the application. It handles database interactions, authentication, and business logic. Technologies include Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and frameworks like Express, Django, and Laravel.</li>
        <li><strong>Full-Stack:</strong> Developers who work on both frontend and backend parts of an application. They have a wide understanding of how web applications function as a whole.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Together, frontend and backend development create the seamless experience that users expect from modern websites. Collaboration between frontend and backend developers ensures efficient and effective web solutions.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>If you’re new to web development, start with the basics: learn HTML to structure your content, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to make it interactive. There are plenty of free resources and tutorials online to help you begin. Once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to more advanced topics like responsive design, APIs, databases, and frameworks.</p>
      <p>Remember that consistency and practice are key. Build small projects, experiment, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Every expert developer started as a beginner, and the journey itself is full of valuable learning experiences.</p>
